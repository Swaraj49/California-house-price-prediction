# California-house-price-prediction
This project is my first Machine Learning model where I built a system to predict house prices using the California Housing Dataset.
The model uses the Random Forest Regressor algorithm to learn patterns from housing features such as location, population, income, and number of rooms.

The main goal of this project is to understand:

How a real-world dataset is handled

How a regression model is trained and evaluated

How machine learning can be applied to price prediction problems
